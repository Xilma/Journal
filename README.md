### Prerequisites

### Installing
Installation process: 
1. Install the apk file (Jot_It_Down.apk)

## Running the tests

Use Expresso. The following link will prove helpful: https://developer.android.com/studio/test/espresso-test-recorder

The Espresso Test Recorder tool lets you create UI tests for your app without writing any test code. 
By recording a test scenario, you can record your interactions with a device and add assertions to verify UI elements in particular snapshots of your app. 
Espresso Test Recorder then takes the saved recording and automatically generates a corresponding UI test that you can run to test your app.
